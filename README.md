# incident_response_sans

This project is a simple html website with some css showing some insight on what the industry standard is on Incident Handling Responses. This would be very helpful not only to individuals, but also for small businesses who are aware of cybersecurity threats. 

In order to run the project, simply clone it to your desktop and open the html file in a server (We used LiveServer).
