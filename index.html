            <h3>What is the SANS response plan?</h3>
            <p1>A SANS Incident Response Plan is a framework that organizations use to respond to security incidents. It is designed to help organizations respond quickly and effectively.. The plan outlines the steps that need to be taken in order to identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from security incidents.
            </p1>

            <h3>Understanding the SANS Incident Response Plan:</h3>
            <p1>In the realm of cybersecurity, knowledge is power, and SANS (Systems Administration and Network Security) stands as a beacon of expertise. Established in 1989, SANS is a global leader in information security training, certification, and research. Delving into their wealth of knowledge is an invaluable resource for any start-up. 
            </p1>

            <h3>The SANS Incident Response Plan Framework:</h3>
            <p1>A SANS Incident Response Plan is more than just a set of guidelines — it's a battle-tested framework. Comprising six crucial steps — Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lesson Learned — it serves as a comprehensive strategy for responding to security incidents. This framework, forged through decades of cybersecurity research, is a proven ally for organizations seeking to safeguard their digital assets.

            <h1>PREPARATION</h1>
            <p1>Review and codify an organizational security policy, perform risk assessment, identify sensitive assets and define which are key incidents the team should focus on. </p1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The goal of this preparation stage is to ensure that the organization can respond to an attack really fast. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are certain  things that the team should prepare in advance. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There should be policy, principle, rules and practices to guide the security process. The policy should be highly visible both to employees. 	
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Secondly there should be a plan for handling by prioritization of incidents. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then there should be a communication plan that states which security team members should be contacted during an incident and for what reasons. 
                    </li>
                    <li>For example, there may be operations staff on call at all hours, everyone in the organization should know which incident responders to contact to help bring systems back up. The communication plan should state the policy for contacting law enforcement, and who should make contact.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the incident is considered a criminal act, your documentation will be used to press charges against suspects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure that CSIRT staff have the appropriate permissions to do their job.

            <h1>IDENTIFICATION</h1>
            <p>This step involves detecting deviations from normal operations in the organization, understanding if a deviation represents a security incident, and determining how important the incident is. [Added this to the description below.]</p>
            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>Identification is a critical phase in the SANS Incident Response Plan, focused on detecting and determining whether an abnormality or deviation from normal operations constitutes a security incident. This phase involves gathering information from various sources, such as log files, error messages, and security tools, to assess whether an event requires further investigation.</p>

            <h3>Steps:</h3> 
            <h3>Monitoring:</h3>
            <p>Continuously monitor network activities, logs, and system alerts to identify any unusual patterns or behaviors. Proactive monitoring helps detect potential security incidents early on.
            Example: Regularly reviewing server logs to identify any unexpected login attempts or suspicious network traffic.</p>

            <h3>Incident Reporting:</h3>
            <p>Establish a straightforward process for employees to report incidents or suspicious activities promptly. Encouraging a culture of reporting ensures that potential issues are addressed before they escalate.
            Example: If an employee receives a phishing email, they should know how and where to report it promptly.</p>

            <h3>Initial Assessment:</h3>
            <p>Conduct a swift initial assessment to determine the nature and scope of a reported incident. This involves gathering information to understand what happened and how it might impact the organization.
            Example: If multiple employees report issues with their computers, perform an initial assessment to determine whether it's a widespread technical problem or a security incident.</p>

            <h3>Communication during Identification:</h3>
            <p>Communication is crucial during the identification phase. Notify the incident response team members and designated command center staff as soon as a potential incident is identified. Effective communication ensures a coordinated and timely response.</p>

            <h3>Documentation:</h3>
            <p>Start documenting the incident from the identification phase onward. This documentation should include the who, what, where, why, and how of the incident. Detailed documentation is crucial for future analysis, legal purposes, and organizational learning.</p>

            <h3>Example Scenario:</h3>
            <p>Imagine an organization notices an unusual spike in network traffic during off-peak hours. Employees report slow system performance, and the IT team receives multiple alerts from intrusion detection systems. The identification phase involves actively monitoring these events, reporting them through established channels, and conducting an initial assessment to understand the scope and potential impact. Once identified, the incident response team can swiftly move to the next phases of the plan.</p>
