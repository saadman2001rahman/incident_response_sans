            <h1>IDENTIFICATION</h1>
            <p>This step involves detecting deviations from normal operations in the organization, understanding if a deviation represents a security incident, and determining how important the incident is. [Added this to the description below.]</p>
            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>Identification is a critical phase in the SANS Incident Response Plan, focused on detecting and determining whether an abnormality or deviation from normal operations constitutes a security incident. This phase involves gathering information from various sources, such as log files, error messages, and security tools, to assess whether an event requires further investigation.</p>

            <h3>Steps:</h3> 
            <h3>Monitoring:</h3>
            <p>Continuously monitor network activities, logs, and system alerts to identify any unusual patterns or behaviors. Proactive monitoring helps detect potential security incidents early on.
            Example: Regularly reviewing server logs to identify any unexpected login attempts or suspicious network traffic.</p>

            <h3>Incident Reporting:</h3>
            <p>Establish a straightforward process for employees to report incidents or suspicious activities promptly. Encouraging a culture of reporting ensures that potential issues are addressed before they escalate.
            Example: If an employee receives a phishing email, they should know how and where to report it promptly.</p>

            <h3>Initial Assessment:</h3>
            <p>Conduct a swift initial assessment to determine the nature and scope of a reported incident. This involves gathering information to understand what happened and how it might impact the organization.
            Example: If multiple employees report issues with their computers, perform an initial assessment to determine whether it's a widespread technical problem or a security incident.</p>

            <h3>Communication during Identification:</h3>
            <p>Communication is crucial during the identification phase. Notify the incident response team members and designated command center staff as soon as a potential incident is identified. Effective communication ensures a coordinated and timely response.</p>

            <h3>Documentation:</h3>
            <p>Start documenting the incident from the identification phase onward. This documentation should include the who, what, where, why, and how of the incident. Detailed documentation is crucial for future analysis, legal purposes, and organizational learning.</p>

            <h3>Example Scenario:</h3>
            <p>Imagine an organization notices an unusual spike in network traffic during off-peak hours. Employees report slow system performance, and the IT team receives multiple alerts from intrusion detection systems. The identification phase involves actively monitoring these events, reporting them through established channels, and conducting an initial assessment to understand the scope and potential impact. Once identified, the incident response team can swiftly move to the next phases of the plan.</p>
        </iden>
        <contain>
            <h1>CONTAINMENT</h1>
            <p>Containment is the phase in the SANS Incident Response Plan where the focus is on limiting the damage caused by the security incident and preventing it from spreading further. The goal is to isolate the affected systems or network segments to stop the incident from escalating.</p>

            <h3>Steps:</h3>

            <h3>Isolation:</h3>
            <p>Immediately isolate the affected systems or network segments to prevent the incident from spreading. This could involve disconnecting compromised devices or restricting network access.
            Example: If malware is detected on a specific server, isolate that server from the rest of the network to prevent the malware from spreading to other systems.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Short-term Measures:</h3>
            <p>Implement short-term measures to quickly limit the impact of the incident. These measures are not intended to be permanent solutions but aim to control the situation until further actions can be taken.
            Example: If a website is under a DDoS attack, implement short-term measures like redirecting traffic through a DDoS protection service to maintain accessibility while investigating the attack.</p>
        </contain>
        <erad>
            <h1>ERADICATION</h1>  
            <p>Eradication is the phase where the focus shifts to completely removing the threat and ensuring that systems are secure. It involves actions to eliminate the root cause of the incident, preventing it from recurring in the future.</p>
            
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>System Restoration:</h3>
                    <p>Restore affected systems to a clean state. This may involve reinstalling the operating system or restoring systems from backups.
                    Example: If a server was compromised, perform a clean reinstall of the operating system and restore data from a backup created before the incident.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Vulnerability Patching:</h3>
                    <p>Identify and address vulnerabilities that were exploited during the incident. Install patches and updates to ensure that the same security weaknesses cannot be exploited again.
                    Example: If the incident revealed that a specific software version had a known vulnerability, apply the necessary patches to eliminate that vulnerability.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Long-term Containment:</h3>
                    <p>Implement measures to ensure the incident does not recur. This involves addressing security gaps, enhancing system defenses, and making strategic changes to prevent a similar incident.
                    Example: Review and update access controls, firewall rules, and security configurations to fortify the organization's defenses against future incidents.</p>

            <p>Ongoing monitoring for a while to observe operations and ensure that the attack does not happen again. In this stage, it is important to check for abnormal behaviors. If there are any further threats existing in the system, they will be detected. </p>


            <p>After the recovery, there should be documentation on the incidents that may have not been documented before. There should be a Lesson Learned meeting. From this meeting, the answers to Who, What, Where, Why and How questions will be included in the documentation. The overall goal from this is to learn from the incident that has taken place and ensure that it does not happen again. Additionally, this documentation can be used as a training resource for new staff of the company. It should also include the suggestions and discussions between members regarding how to improve the system and the overall team.</p>
