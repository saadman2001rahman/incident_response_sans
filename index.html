            <h3>What is the SANS response plan?</h3>
            <p1>A SANS Incident Response Plan is a framework that organizations use to respond to security incidents. It is designed to help organizations respond quickly and effectively.. The plan outlines the steps that need to be taken in order to identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from security incidents.
            </p1>

            <h3>Understanding the SANS Incident Response Plan:</h3>
            <p1>In the realm of cybersecurity, knowledge is power, and SANS (Systems Administration and Network Security) stands as a beacon of expertise. Established in 1989, SANS is a global leader in information security training, certification, and research. Delving into their wealth of knowledge is an invaluable resource for any start-up. 
            </p1>

            <h3>The SANS Incident Response Plan Framework:</h3>
            <p1>A SANS Incident Response Plan is more than just a set of guidelines — it's a battle-tested framework. Comprising six crucial steps — Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lesson Learned — it serves as a comprehensive strategy for responding to security incidents. This framework, forged through decades of cybersecurity research, is a proven ally for organizations seeking to safeguard their digital assets.

            <h1>PREPARATION</h1>
            <p1>Review and codify an organizational security policy, perform risk assessment, identify sensitive assets and define which are key incidents the team should focus on. </p1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The goal of this preparation stage is to ensure that the organization can respond to an attack really fast. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are certain  things that the team should prepare in advance. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There should be policy, principle, rules and practices to guide the security process. The policy should be highly visible both to employees. 	
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Secondly there should be a plan for handling by prioritization of incidents. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then there should be a communication plan that states which security team members should be contacted during an incident and for what reasons. 
                    </li>
                    <li>For example, there may be operations staff on call at all hours, everyone in the organization should know which incident responders to contact to help bring systems back up. The communication plan should state the policy for contacting law enforcement, and who should make contact.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the incident is considered a criminal act, your documentation will be used to press charges against suspects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure that CSIRT staff have the appropriate permissions to do their job.
